# tinsel-os
A re-write of v-os, just done to higher standards.

## Notes:
As of this commit, there is just one command: shutdown, which works as expected.
The main difference between this version and the last is that this one has been written
properly and not in a silly way that breaks all the time -- granted it could crash at any point
since I'm yet to make a proper error handler system etc etc. Also you can't backspace into the printf'd stuff - so that's cool.

## PS:
This is meant to be a personal project for understanding modern computer systems, not a completely functioning OS that does everything a kernel like Linux or NT or OSX can.
